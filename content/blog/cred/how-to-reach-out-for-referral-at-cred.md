I got 100+ direct messages on LinkedIn for the referral at CRED in the last couple of days. Found it very difficult to analyze the candidate's suitability with the job profile.
So to streamline the process and make it fair for everyone, I've created a google form.

Fill this google form to double your chances of getting a referral.

Form Link: [CRED Referral form](https://forms.gle/3yV5J3Avu9fmTRPR8)

**_NOTE: This is not an official referral form. I've created it personally to analyze the candidates effectively._**

There is no guarantee that you will get a call for the interview after getting referred. You need to stand out from others in-order to get the call.

## How to stand out?

Modify your resume according the job profile you are applying to. Make sure to add relevant projects and experience needed for the role.
Good to have these in your resume:

- Portfolio link
- GitHub/Stackoverflow link
- Twitter/LinkedIn link
- Hobbies
