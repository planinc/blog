I joined [CRED](https://cred.club) on 23rd Aug 2021 as a frontend engineer. It's been over a month now and I am truly having a great time working here. The past one month has been a great learning experience for me. My journey started with CRED Assemble sessions in which folks from different teams openly share knowledge about their work. They openly shared the stats and numbers that shows their impact in CRED's growth. I attended 4-6 sessions daily for two weeks straight. Finally I had a better and realistic understanding of how CRED's make money.

There is a tradition of assigning a buddy to every new team member. I am very lucky to have [Himanshu Singh](https://twitter.com/qwerty__ui) as my buddy. He took my first interview and it was amazing to interact with him. I really liked how he explained me about taking decisions in choosing the right employer. You can read my [interview experience](https://rahuldkjain.github.io/blog/cred-interview/CRED-interview-experience/) to know more. He contacted me even before joining CRED. He was there right from the beginning to clear doubts. We both had a great time in Buddy Banter sessions.

After the assemble sessions I started learning about the web ecosystem at CRED. Started diving into the codebase to get a good understanding of the architecture. After going through the codebase I realized these technical gaps to overcome:

- Error Boundaries: which don't break the whole app if something crashes.
- MobX: elegant state management library.
- XState: using Finite State Machines in code. Finally something that I learned in college lectures.
- Storybook: UI components explorer
- Typescript: still a noob here. I know few type checks and interface only.
- Xcode: how to run apps in iOS simulator to debug webview.

I brushed these concepts from FrontendMasters courses.

I recently solved a UI bug which is coming up only in iOS 15. This took me 2 days to setup things in Xcode in-order to debug. This boasted my confidence towards codebase.

I am currently working on a component library with my team. Let's see how it goes.

CRED sends such amazing gifts every month. I am speechless how CRED as an organization takes care of the shareholders. Everyone at CRED is a shareholder because every employee owns CRED's ESOPs.

## Events

CRED organized a Poker tournament worth 10Lac of prize money ðŸ¤‘. I learned how to play poker and secured the 141th position out of 196. Not bad ha!
CRED is organizing the Badminton League in Bangalore. FOMOed!!

CRED also organizes social sessions. It invites creative talents like beat-boxer, singer, & illusionist etc every saturday on zoom.
