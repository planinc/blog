## Intro

I cleared the round 1, 2 and appeared for the round 3. I really liked the flexibility to schedule the interview as per my choice. I need to brush up my Javascript & React knowledge, so I took a week time before the round 3.

## Experience: Tech Round 3

I again met an amazing developer at CRED during the interview. It started with a basic introduction & then he started talking about work and projects at CRED. Interviewer asked me about my expectation in terms of work. Then he asked me introduce myself with what I do, what I like and all. So I opened my [bio](https://about.rahuldkjain.vercel.app/) and shared the screen to give him a better picture of myself. I told him about my work at zolo, freelancing, animation, and open-source projects. He asked me about why I want to switch and all.

Then the actual interview started with a basic machine coding problem in React. The task was to develop a form based web application with input fields like PAN Number, & Aadhar Number etc. He wanted to test React skills on how I maintain the the states of the input fields. Then he started questioning about optimization aspect of the web-app when there are 10+ input fields.

When I completed the code, he started asking me the following questions:

- Is it good to attach a state to every input field and modify it onChange, when there are 10+ input fields. Answer it in terms of scalability? (✅)
- How to handle forms without states in React? (✅)
- Event Delegation? (✅)
- How to make decision on which framework to use (Gatsby, Next or CRA)(❌)


## Results
Cleared the round 3 & scheduled the cultural fit round.
