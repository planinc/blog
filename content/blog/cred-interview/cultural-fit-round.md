## Intro

I cleared the round 1, 2, 3 and appeared for the cultural fit round. I really liked the flexibility to schedule the interview as per my choice.

## Experience: Cultural Fit Round

Tech Leat at CRED took this round. The interview started with the basic introduction and then started briefing me about the feedback in all 3 tech rounds. He told me that I need to grow my Javascript skills, which totally made sense to me. Then he started questioning me about:


- How do you grow your skills on daily basis?
- Why do you want to join CRED?
- Do you believe in work-life balance?
- Are you baised towards certain work or open to work with any tech skill?
- What are the things that you hate about CRED?


## Results
Cleared the round and got the offer letter after the salary discussion round.
