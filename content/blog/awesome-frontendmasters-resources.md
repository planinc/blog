I used my GitHub Student Developer Pack to redeem FrontendMasters' 6-month membership. I fell in love with the quality of their courses and all of them are created by top-notch professionals around the globe. Beautifully designed course material (documentation, code, and slides) is the cherry on top.

I learned Reactjs, Nextjs, SVG Animations, and React-Native from FrontendMasters courses, and I always refer to the course documentation instead of official documentation whenever needed. One day when I got stuck with *how to do dynamic routing in nextjs*, I referred to the course documentation of **Intro to Nextjs course by Scott Moss** and got the answer in just a couple of seconds. 

There is no need to go through the course videos if you are comfortable with reading the documentation. Although the courses are paid, you can refer to the course material (documentation, slides, and code) for free.

My membership is about to expire so I collected all the course resources and created an awesome list to help developers like me to get access to these gems.

There are **75+** such course resources in this list and it's not a good idea to make this article big.
