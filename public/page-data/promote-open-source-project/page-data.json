In just 45 days the project got <strong>1000+ stars</strong>, <strong>120+ forks</strong>, and <strong>30+ PRs</strong> on GitHub. It received sponsorships from two experienced developers. Google Analytics reads that it got 10,000+ visitors so far. Got featured in several YouTube videos and blogs.</p>\n<p>I believe that sharing the process followed by me will help you to get the gist of the same. Go through the following steps sequentially to understand the whole process.</p>\n<h2>1. Wireframe the IDEA 🖊</h2>\n<p>Take a pen &#x26; a paper and just draw whatever comes in your mind related to the idea. Don’t worry about your drawing ability and just jot it down. It will give you more realistic view about the idea.</p>\n<p>Once you have it on paper, start drawing how it should work. Brainstorm every possible workflow you have in mind.</p>\n<p>I was seeing a lot of addons for GitHub profile README coming up, so I came up with the idea of <a href=\"https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator\">GitHub Profile README Generator</a>.</p>\n<p>I brainstormed several ideas on how should make it simple, useful, and elegant for users.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ame1y0MJNqUPC/giphy.gif\" alt=\"idea\"></p>\n<p>Once you get the holistic picture of what you are thinking, pick the best one, and freeze it.</p>\n<h2>2. Execute 👨‍💻</h2>\n<p>Almost every one of us usually loses interest to develop the project after coming up with an IDEA. Is it really worth it? People really gonna use it or am I just wasting my time? etc questions like these start haunting the mind.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZQrVQtav6gnzG/giphy.gif\" alt=\"confused\"></p>\n<p>This happened to me too and I said it to myself that <strong>Who cares?</strong>. Yep, it’s true who cares.</p>\n<p>So stop thinking about it and just execute it. It doesn’t matter whether people will like it or not, but the experience of going from an idea in the mind to the idea online is simply worth doing.</p>\n<h2>3. Promote 🚀</h2>\n<p>Let the world know about the masterpiece you’ve developed. To reach a wider audience for feedback, promotion is very important. This step will make you realize the power of platforms like <strong>DEV</strong>, <strong>Reddit</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, and <strong>YouTube</strong>, etc.\nI’ve posted a separate blog on <a href=\"https://rahuldkjain.github.io/blog/how-github-profile-readme-generator-reached-200+-stars-on-github/\">how to promote your project online?</a>. Go check and read it out.</p>\n<p>I am telling you that having a cool open-source project is an amazing feeling. So don’t think and wait, just execute it. Let the world know about your crazy ideas, don’t hesitate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/kEKcOWl8RMLde/giphy.gif\" alt=\"happy\"></p>\n<p>Wish you very good luck on your upcoming journey.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding 👨‍💻👩‍💻!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to start and promote your open-source project?","date":"August 26, 2020","description":"Steps that I followed to start and promote my project that got 1000+ stars on github"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/promote-open-source-project/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docker/docker-file/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dockerfile"}},"next":null}}}
