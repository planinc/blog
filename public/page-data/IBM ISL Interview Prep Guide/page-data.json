It tests the candidates INFERENCE, DEDUCTION and MATH skills in a strict time pressured environment.</p>\n<p>IPAT provides IBM the ability to compare applicants globally on a standardized, common measure scale.</p>\n<p>Here are some important instructions for IPAT:</p>\n<p><strong>What is the test format?</strong><br>\nTwo sections â€“ Numeric series and Math reasoning with 18 questions in each section. There might be some geographical variation but this is the standard observed.  </p>\n<p><strong>What is the question format?</strong><br>\nMultiple choice format â€“ 5 choices provided per question with only 1 correct answer  </p>\n<p><strong>What is the time provided per question?</strong><br>\nThe time provided per question is 2 mins 15 seconds â€“ a timer on the screen will help you keep track of time for each questions  </p>\n<p><strong>Is a calculator permitted?</strong><br>\nYes! Not only is it permitted, a calculator is encouraged  </p>\n<p><strong>Can the test be retaken?</strong><br>\nThe test does not allow retakes for 1 year and hence it is critical to get it right the first time around.</p>\n<p>Two Sections in the IPAT are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Numeric series problems</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/difference-series\">Difference based Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/common-rule/\">Common Rule Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/pairs/\">Pair Wise Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/interleaved-series/\">Interleaved Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/power-based-series/\">Power based Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/exotic-series/\">Exotic Series</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Math reasoning problems</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/ratios-and-percentages/\">Ratios and Percentages</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/work/\">Work and Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/ipat-geometry\">IPAT Geometry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/mixtures-and-compounds\">Mixtures and Compounds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://masteribmipat.com/interest-and-probability\">Interest and Probability</a></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are two printers. One printer prints 70 copies in 15 min and other printer prints 50 copies in 20 min. The first printer starts at 7:30 AM and the second printer starts at 7:00 AM. At which time they will print the equal number of copies? <strong>(Time &#x26; Work)</strong></li>\n<li>John has a flat which cost is 15000 rs. After one year, its cost down by 2000 rs but for next years its cost increase by 5%.

The one thing that I learnt is that never expect anything out of the recruitment. Anything can happen. Even those who donâ€™t know any technical stuff get selected and even best matched candidate will not be selected. Anything can happen during the recruitments. The Key is to KEEP GOING AHEAD keeping in mind that there are millions of companies in this whole world and there will be some companies which will respect and recognize your talent and hard work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸŽ¯ IBM ISL SDE Internship Interview Experience","date":"April 06, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/IBM ISL Interview Prep Guide/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Oracle RGBU Interview Prep Guide/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸŽ¯ Oracle RGBU SDE Internship Interview Experience"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Coviam Interview Prep Guide/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ðŸŽ¯ Coviam Technologies SDE Internship Interview Experience"}}}}}
