Never thought that so many developers will find it useful.</p>\n<p>The open-source community is amazing. The project on GitHub received two pull requests without even opening an issue.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/natfriedman?lang=en\">Nat Friedman</a> <strong>CEO of GitHub</strong> followed me on twitter.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/linus_borg?lang=en\">Thorsten L√ºnborg</a>, a member of the Vuejs core team even starred the repositoryüôá.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/659mdvod4dq11bjmckt3.png\" alt=\"github-profile-readme-generator\"></p>\n<h2>How I achieved it?</h2>\n<p>Now the question is How I did it. The strategy I followed is a mix of a few steps which are as follows</p>\n<h4>1. Cool project README</h4>\n<p>Project README on Github puts the first impression of the project. To win the battle i.e to gain attention I designed a visually interesting README using <strong>gifs</strong>, <strong>badges</strong>, and <strong>emojis</strong>. It looks like this</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3eelbp0qua074rnu2det.png\" alt=\"github-profile-readme-generator README\"></p>\n<h4>2. Post about project on Dev.to using #showdev</h4>\n<p>I am quite active on dev.to and understands the power of it. So I wrote <a href=\"https://dev.to/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator-with-addons-like-visitors-count-github-stats-etc-44bg\">this article</a> for the same.</p>\n<p>Guess what, it got 1400+ views. Organic reach is pretty amazing on dev.to.\nYour blog post must display the capabilities and uniqueness about the project.</p>\n<h4>3. Promote the project on other platforms(LinkedIn/Reddit/Discord/Twitter)</h4>\n<p>I am quite active on LinkedIn too. So I took advantage of this and wrote a post regarding the tool. Organic reach of LinkedIn is amazing too and the post was reaching 1000+ people per hour for the first 12 hours. The post became a hit and reached 24000+ people on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs it! Dev.to and LinkedIn proved out to be a super awesome platform to reach the targetted audience organically.</p>\n<p>PS: If you haven‚Äôt checked out the tool yet, go check it out</p>\n<p>üöÄ Try the tool - <a href=\"https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/\">live demo</a>\nProject Link - <a href=\"https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator\">https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to gain 1000+ starsüåü on an open-source project quickly?","date":"July 20, 2020","description":"generate github profile readme with latest add-ons like visitors count, shields, dev icons, github stats, etc with cool UI."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/how-github-profile-readme-generator-reached-200+-stars-on-github/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/github-profile-readme-generator/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Github profile README generator with latest addons like visitors-count"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bash/bash-scripting-cheatsheet/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bash Scripting Cheatsheet"}}}}}
