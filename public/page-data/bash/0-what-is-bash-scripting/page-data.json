While executing a command, you cannot interact with the bash shell. As soon as bash is done executing a command, it returns to you for the next command to execute. </p>\n<p>Bash gets commands by reading lines. As soon as it’s read enough lines to compose a complete command, bash begins running that command. Usually, commands are just a single line long. An interactive bash session reads lines from you at the prompt. Non-interactive bash processes read their commands from a file or stream. Files with a hashbang as their first line (and the executable permission) can be started by your system’s kernel like any other program. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is bash?
