Thought of animation related to wind energy came to my mind because of the ongoing windy season.</p>\n<p>So I present to you the 7th post for <strong>#10daysofanimation</strong> series. I am doing this series because of the reason that it enables me to develop interesting animations of small size(~ 10-20KB) to make it feasible for web animations. I followed <code class=\"language-text\">gsap</code> library over <code class=\"language-text\">css-animations</code> by taking inspiration from a course on <strong>frontend masters</strong>. If you want to know about the course, leave a comment. </p>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>Today’s challenge is to animate the windmill in such a way that it looks more real and interesting.</p>\n<h2>Solution Journey</h2>\n<p>Let’s see the journey to understand the cycle.</p>\n<h4>1. Wireframing the animation</h4>\n<p>This step involves drawing the animation ideas(at least 3 ideas) on a piece of paper. The sketches need not be perfect, it is only meant for evolving to a good idea. I came up with 4 ideas that involve elements like windmill, birds, clouds, and wind. Then after a lot of thinking and playing, I locked the idea and decided to go with it.</p>\n<h4>2. SVG Image with proper <code class=\"language-text\">ids</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">classes</code></h4>\n<p>The basic element of the animation is the windmill. I googled <code class=\"language-text\">windmill svg</code> and found nothing cool that suits my idea. So, I designed the SVG(<strong>size ~5KB</strong>) using illustrator. The reason why I manually designed it is the size and the ease of assigning <code class=\"language-text\">ids</code> to the elements.</p>\n<h4>3. Animate elements using gsap</h4>\n<p>I divided the animation into three sub animations as</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RotateBlades</strong>: to rotate the blades of windmill</li>\n<li><strong>FlowingWind</strong>: show wind to add a natural touch</li>\n<li><strong>FlyingBirds</strong>: show birds to make it interesting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I compiled all the three into one using <code class=\"language-text\">gsap.timeline()</code>.\nThe animation looks like this</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://codepen.io/rahuldkjain/embed/preview/MWKXNvv\" style=\"width:100%; height:300px;\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Looks cool right! The best part of developing such animations is the <strong>size</strong>. Anyone can easily add such animations into their website/web-app to enhance the UX(User Experience).</p>\n<p>Happy Animating!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Windmill animation in 10KB","date":"July 12, 2020","description":"rotating windmill svg animation using gsap.timeline gsap.to gsap.fromTo in 10KB of size"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gsap-animation-series/6-windmill-animation-gsap/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/gsap-animation-series/5-readme-banner-morphSVG/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Animated banner to be used in repository readme"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/github-profile-readme-generator/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Github profile README generator with latest addons like visitors-count"}}}}}
