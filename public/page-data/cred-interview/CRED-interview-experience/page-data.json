But it’s more of a lifestyle brand than being a fin-tech product. One needs to have a good credit-score to become a CRED member &#x26; enjoy benefits, which means it filters out the customers with low credit score. It’s a smart way to provide value experience to the customers.</p>\n<!-- CRED has not became a profit making company yet and still investing more in marketing to gain a large user base, I see an amazing opportunity to grow my skills by contributing in their vision. -->\n<h2>How I landed the interview?</h2>\n<p>I created my profile on <a href=\"https://www.instahyre.com/\">Instahyre</a> and updated all the necessary details to stand out from the crowd. In just 2 days, I received a call from an HR at CRED about a frontend developer role &#x26; I decided to give it a try.</p>\n<h2>Interview Process</h2>\n<p>CRED conduct 3-5 interview rounds.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tech Round 1: 90 minutes</li>\n<li>Tech Round 2: 90 minutes</li>\n<li>Tech Round 3: 90 minutes</li>\n<li>Cultural Fit Round: 60 minutes</li>\n<li>Salary Discussion: 30 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Tech Round 1</h1>\n<p>I met an amazing developer at CRED during the interview. It started with a basic introduction &#x26; then we started talking about Work From Home, Coronavirus, &#x26; Monsoon, etc. Interviewer told me about the working culture, his journey till now and the ongoing projects in web-team at CRED. Then he asked me introduce myself with what I do, what I like and all. So I opened my <a href=\"https://about.rahuldkjain.vercel.app/\">bio</a> and shared the screen to give him a better picture of myself. I told him about my work at Zolo, freelancing, animation, and open-source projects. We discussed about business models of CRED and Zolo. He asked me about why I want to switch and all. Then he gave me a moderate javascript problem. I read the problem, repeated what I understood so that we can be on the same page. I prepared the process in my mind and explained him with pseudo codes. Then I started live coding the problem. He gave me hints to make the code working and optimized. I completed the problem. Then we talked about why he joined CRED and how he made the decision to join CRED etc. It was an amazing experience overall. I met a nice developer.</p>\n<!-- ## Problem\n```js\n// applySpec(): Given a specification object that\n// recursively maps properties to functions,\n// applySpec takes in this specification object and\n// returns a function that when called with some arguments\n// produces an object of the same structure.\n\n// For Eg:\n\nconst getMetrics = applySpec({\n  sum: (a, b) => a + b, // sum is called with (2, 4)\n  nested: {\n    mul: (a, b) => a * b, // mul is called with (2, 4)\n  },\n  sub: (a, b) => a - b,\n});\n\nconsole.log(getMetrics(2, 4)); // => { sum: 6, nested: { mul: 8 } }\n``` -->\n<!-- ## Solution\n\n```js\nconst getMetrics = applySpec({\n  sum: (a, b) => a + b, // sum is called with (2, 4)\n  nested: {\n    mul: (a, b) => a * b, // mul is called with (2, 4)\n  },\n  sub: (a, b) => a - b,\n});\n\nfunction process(specObj, args) {\n  let newObj = {};\n  let keys = Object.keys(specObj);\n  keys.forEach((key) => {\n    if (typeof specObj[key] === \"function\") {\n      newObj[key] = specObj[key](...args);\n    } else if (typeof specObj[key] === \"object\") {\n      let newSpecObj = specObj[key];\n      newObj[key] = process(newSpecObj, args);\n    }\n  });\n  return newObj;\n}\n\nfunction applySpec(specObj) {\n  return function (...args) {\n    console.log(\"HOC=>\", args);\n    return process(specObj, args);\n  };\n}\n``` -->\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Cleared the round 1 &#x26; scheduled the round 2 for next week.</p>\n<h1>Tech Round 2</h1>\n<p>I cleared the round 1 and appeared for the round 2. I really liked the flexibility to schedule the interview as per my choice. I need to brush up my Javascript knowledge, so I took a week time before the round 2.</p>\n<p>I again met an amazing developer at CRED during the interview. It started with a basic introduction &#x26; then he started talking about work and projects at CRED. Interviewer asked me about my expectation in terms of work. Then he asked me introduce myself with what I do, what I like and all. So I opened my <a href=\"https://about.rahuldkjain.vercel.app/\">bio</a> and shared the screen to give him a better picture of myself. I told him about my work at Zolo, freelancing, animation, and open-source projects. He asked me about why I want to switch and all. Then he gave me a moderate machine coding problem. The task to develop a search box that gives suggestions on input. He gave me the API to fetch the suggestions. I asked him about the functionalities like debouncing, events and all to properly understand the requirements. He told me to develop it in vanilla javascript. When I completed the code, he started asking me the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approach to attach the click event listeners on the suggestions? Event bubbling, event delegation? (✅)</li>\n<li>Difference between <code class=\"language-text\">defer</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">async</code> scripts, their pros and cons. (✅)</li>\n<li>Modular scripts, scopes, IIFE. (✅)</li>\n<li>Loading of CSS files is synchronous or asynchronous? Does it blocks the HTML parsing? (❌)</li>\n<li>Why react? How react works under the hood? (❌)</li>\n<li>What is virtualDOM? Its advantage? (❌)</li>\n<li>Why Nextjs? Dynamic routes in file based routing? Advantages of Nextjs over React? Can we switch to client side rendering or pre-rendering in Nextjs? (❌)</li>\n<li>React states, Layout, Scalability. (✅)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- ## Solution\n\n```js\n// index.html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" />\n    <script src=\"script.js\" defer></script>\n    <script defer>\n      console.log(\"hi\")\n      console.log(searchField)\n    </script>\n    <title>Practice JS</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"search-container\">\n      <div id=\"search-input-container\">\n        <input\n          type=\"text\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter Country\"\n          id=\"search-input\"\n          name=\"search\"\n        />\n        <ul id=\"suggestions\"></ul>\n      </div>\n      <button id=\"search-btn\">Search</button>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```css\n/* style.css */\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Poppins\";\n  height: 100vh;\n  width: 100%;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n.search-container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n#search-input {\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 48px;\n  padding: 8px;\n  position: relative;\n}\n#search-btn {\n  border: 0;\n  padding: 5px 10px;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  height: 50px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n#suggestions {\n  height: 210px;\n  width: 300px;\n  background: #efefef;\n  display: none;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n  position: absolute;\n}\n\nli {\n  list-style-type: none;\n}\n.suggestion {\n  height: 40px;\n  padding: 10px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  color: black;\n}\n.suggestion:hover {\n  background-color: aliceblue;\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// script.js\nvar searchField = document.getElementById(\"search-input\");\nlet suggestionsContainer = document.getElementById(\"suggestions\");\n\n(() => {})();\nsearchField.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n  let keyword = e.target.value;\n  if (keyword) {\n    fetchResults(keyword);\n  } else {\n    removeOldSuggestions();\n    suggestionsContainer.style.display = \"none\";\n  }\n});\n\nconst fetchResults = async (keyword) => {\n  const data = await fetch(\n    `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${keyword}?fields=name`\n  );\n  const json = await data.json();\n  populateSuggestions(json.slice(0, 5));\n};\n\nconst populateSuggestions = (list) => {\n  if (list) {\n    // remove the old suggestions\n    removeOldSuggestions();\n    // append new suggestions\n    list.forEach((country) => {\n      let elem = document.createElement(\"li\");\n      elem.setAttribute(\"class\", \"suggestion\");\n      elem.innerHTML = country.name;\n      suggestionsContainer.append(elem);\n    });\n  }\n  suggestionsContainer.style.display = \"block\";\n};\n\nconst removeOldSuggestions = () => {\n  // remove the old suggestions\n  while (suggestionsContainer.lastElementChild) {\n    suggestionsContainer.removeChild(suggestionsContainer.lastElementChild);\n  }\n};\n``` -->\n<h2>Result</h2>\n<p>Cleared the round 2 &#x26; scheduled the round 3 for next week.</p>\n<h1>Tech Round 3</h1>\n<p>I cleared the round 1, 2 and appeared for the round 3.
